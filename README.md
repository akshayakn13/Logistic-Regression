# About the donor's choose dataset

Founded in 2000 by a high school teacher in the Bronx, DonorsChoose.org empowers public school teachers from across the country to request much-needed materials and experiences for their students. At any given time, there are thousands of classroom requests that can be brought to life with a gift of any amount.

DonorsChoose.org receives hundreds of thousands of project proposals each year for classroom projects in need of funding. Right now, a large number of volunteers is needed to manually screen each submission before it's approved to be posted on the DonorsChoose.org website.

Next year, DonorsChoose.org expects to receive close to 500,000 project proposals. As a result, there are three main problems they need to solve:

    How to scale current manual processes and resources to screen 500,000 projects so that they can be posted as quickly and as efficiently as possible

    How to increase the consistency of project vetting across different volunteers to improve the experience for teachers

    How to focus volunteer time on the applications that need the most assistance
    
   #### The goal is to predict whether or not a DonorsChoose.org project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved, using the text of project descriptions as well as additional metadata about the project, teacher, and school. DonorsChoose.org can then use this information to identify projects most likely to need further review before approval.
   
   # About the alogorithm
   Logistic regression is another technique borrowed by machine learning from the field of statistics.It is the go-to method for binary classification problems (problems with two class values). In this technique input values (x) are combined linearly using weights or coefficient values (referred to as the Greek capital letter Beta) to predict an output value (y)
